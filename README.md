# Covid_19-Classification
This project focuses on building a machine learning classification model on an imbalanced COVID-19 dataset. Different imbalance handling techniques such as class weighting and XGBoost’s scale_pos_weight are applied to improve minority class prediction. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
